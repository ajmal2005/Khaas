Khaas is a dual-purpose utility app designed for personal safety and social management. It overrides system "Silent/Do Not Disturb" modes for specific "VIP" contacts, ensuring you wake up or get alerted for emergencies. Conversely, it features a "Fake Call" escape button to gracefully exit unwanted situations.

📱 Key Features
1. Priority Access Mode
Always-On Alert: If a designated VIP contact calls, the app detects it via TelephonyManager and forces the phone to ring, even if the physical switch is set to Silent or Vibrate.

2. The Escape Button (Fake Call)
Instant Trigger: One-tap activation to simulate an incoming call.

Realistic UI: Mimics the native Android call screen (Answer/Decline buttons) to provide a convincing excuse to leave a meeting or awkward conversation.

3. Contact Management
Native Integration: Seamlessly imports contacts from the device's address book.

Zero-Friction UI: Clean, minimalist interface with swipe-to-delete and pop-up editing tools.
